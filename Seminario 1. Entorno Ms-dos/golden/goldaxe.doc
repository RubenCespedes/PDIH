----< GOLDEN AXE >----

The Golden Axe takes on a horrible new cast...

The  Death  Adder  and  his  evil  forces  have  invaded  the  land,
immprisoned  the  king and  his  daughter and  stolen the  legendary
Golden  Axe.  Only the  three  heroes  of  Yuria  have the  power to
stop  the  ruthless  tyrant  and  regain  the  throne.  Tyris-Flare,
a beautiful  and  powerful  amazon,  has summoned  her fire magic to
eliminate the Adder and his orphan-making fiends. Gilius-Thunderhead
rumbles and tumbles to the scene with  his  astonishing  combination
of lightning power and gymnastics skills.  And the Axe Battler,  who
has a personal bone to pick with the evil  Adder,  has sharpened his
giant sword for battle.  *You*  must choose which challenger to send
into the dreaded path of the Death Adder.

The once idyllic Eagle Island has been  transformed into a  real bird
of prey, trapping the good Yurians in its infested feathers. Fearless
Skeleton Swordsman slash through the mangy  battlefield, hunting down
Adder's enemies. Meanwhile, Twin Brutes and Lizard Women spread their
horror in the once prosperous  Turtle Village.  The  precocious Death
Adder Jr.  throws knots of  electricity from the palace door, barring
entrance  to the  stolen throne.  Your weapons range from razor-sharp
swords to  curtains of fire. You can even joust with your foes on the
back  of  a  bizarrian  -  stolen  from  an  un-saddled  Adder fiend!
Remember, one dose of magic can wipe away an acre of evil.
